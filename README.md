Javascript Final Project with Chris A and Matt M

Opening of Game:
Start page would be a standalone page with game logo and a center button that says start game. This would bring up the character creation screen which prompts the user for their name and allows them to pick a gender (male or female). These two variables would change various prompts throughout the game for personalization. After the “Create Character” button, a series pictures and messages will set up the back story of the game. Located on the main page will also be a Help button that will bring up a menu/screen of assistance and descriptions of the game mechanics.

Game Map:
We want to use a visual interface for the map if at all possible to help convey where the user is. There will be directional buttons (up, down, left, right) to control movement on the map. When a user is “at” a specific place, there will be a label that appears below the map.

Game Entities:
Hero\Main character: This is who the user is.

Townsperson: Random person in game, may or may not give helpful information

Shopkeeper: This is where the user can buy items from.

Items: There will be a minimal amount of items, depending on what weapon item the user has, depends on the chances of winning during combat.

Enemies: There will be two different kinds of enemies, your standard random monsters and the occasional more powerful boss. As the user progresses through the game, the enemies get harder to defeat.

Actions:
Directional controls (up/down/left/right): This allows the user to move throughout the game

Talk: allows user to talk to a person\shopkeeper.

Fight: Allows user to fight enemy
	During fight there may be options to Attack or Evade

Run: Allows user to run away during fight

Help: There will also be a help button located, similar to the one on the main page.

Endgame Scenarios:
One way to end the game is to beat the final boss battle. Once the final boss is beaten, the game is over. 

The other way is if the player runs out of lives. Once the last life has been used, the game will start over.
