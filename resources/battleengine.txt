First we need a flag to count how many bosses
the person has fought and defeated so when they 
have defeated the 3 bosses,they can proceed to the final boss. 

character.bossct

player and boss have their specified attack level. We do a random
roll between those attack levels and whoever gets the higher one wins
that attack and hits the opponent.

Then for actual attack damage dealt it can 1 damage to keep it simple since the player only has 10HP

If the player hits 0 life points, 
they will be spawned at the center of the map and lose their gold

In terms of our character vs monster. I think we need three scenarios.   
1) If character has less attack than the monster then it favors the monster. 25\75     
2) If equal, it's completely random…50\50 shot    
3) If character has more then favors character. 75\25

Boss 1 
	10 attack
	hp = 10

Boss 2
	15 attack
	hp = 12

Boss 3
	20 attack
	hp = 17

Boss 4

	25 attack
	hp = 23

There will be no set way to defeat the first 3 bosses, the player can do whenever

We will let the player know which one is hard/ medium/ easy though
